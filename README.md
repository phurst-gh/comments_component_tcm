# comments_component_tcm

1. There are 2 scripts that generate comments:

- First script is built as simple as I could whilst keeping things clean.
	
- Second script utilises OOP.
      
2. The OOP script needs activating in the index.html (remove comment tags, add to alternate script)
  
3. OOP/modules are quite new to me so I may be a little off here. I'm learning fast and personally
    much prefer this more secure approach to programming. The script needed here felt a little 
    small to require OOP but I wasn't sure of your preference and wanted to show my understnading 
    of it.
